# Universal parser rollout contract

The worldwide parser is a separate bounded context from the launch-tested UAE
and Saudi importer. New market packs may inspect and suggest, but they do not
enter the shipping auto-import router until their own bank/template fixtures
meet every gate below. A changed or unknown template falls back to review.

## First-wave market packs

- United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Netherlands.
- India, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Jordan.

The pack vocabulary is seeded from bank, central-bank and payment-network
documentation. Most US and European institutions publish alert categories but
not stable message bodies, so those seeds remain synthetic until consented,
locally redacted fixtures prove an exact institution/channel/template grammar.

The review interface now carries market-scoped institution candidates from
sender and body evidence for representative first-wave banks. Exact sender and
body agreement is identified; conflicts remain ambiguous; unknown senders stay
unknown. These research identities do not claim that a bank's message formats
are supported, and institution evidence never bypasses transaction safety.

## Automatic market routing

Country selection is not a parser input for the worldwide review path. Each
alert is routed independently from its sender/institution identity, localized
bank grammar, payment rail and currency evidence. Device region is only a
supporting hint: it cannot create a route, and it cannot override a bank alert
from another country. This matters for expatriates, travellers and foreign
cards.

The router returns `single`, `ambiguous` or `unknown`; it does not expose an
uncalibrated confidence percentage and it never returns the source or sender.
Generic USD/EUR symbols, English or Arabic text, and an overlapping global
brand such as HSBC remain ambiguous without market-specific evidence. Two
independent consistent alerts can resolve a provisional capture market;
duplicate copies of one alert cannot manufacture consensus.

Routing is not import authorization. UAE and Saudi automatic capture continues
through the launch parser. First-wave global routes feed only the review path
until the corresponding bank/template rollout gates pass.

## Private review tray

A global alert reaches the encrypted review tray only after the launch parser
returns no transaction and the worldwide inspector finds one posted,
institution-backed transaction with an exact currency, exponent, amount,
direction and supported family. Authentication, failed, future, statement,
balance, mandate-lifecycle, unknown-direction and ambiguous-amount messages are
discarded rather than shown as parser failures.

Tray items contain structured evidence only—no raw message, sender, account
reference, parser reason or candidate list. Pending items expire after 30 days
and are capped at 50. Add/dismiss decisions leave only an opaque, expiring
tombstone so rescans do not nag the user. The tray is excluded from editable
backups and never creates transactions, bills or subscriptions automatically.

Android performs review admission on-device. The iOS relay now provides the
same review fallback for known UAE/Saudi bank senders: it discards the message
text and sender, then seals only exact money, direction, institution, family,
masked instrument and opaque keyed identities to the phone. The app persists
that item in its encrypted tray before acknowledging the relay row. This is
launch-market parity, not worldwide parity; non-UAE/Saudi relay misses remain
discarded until their own threat model and rollout evidence exist.

## Ledger money staging

Persisted ledgers now carry an explicit ISO currency and minor-unit exponent
while keeping every existing UAE/Saudi `*Fils` integer unchanged. The first
schema accepts exponents 0, 2 and 3 so currencies such as JPY, AED/USD and KWD
have exact input/format primitives. This is storage preparation, not permission
to auto-import global alerts: import, FX, relay, reports and backup-version
contracts still need end-to-end currency enforcement before those rows may
enter the ledger.

India has stronger standardized evidence: NPCI publishes AEPS success,
decline, reversal, withdrawal, balance-enquiry and transfer alert families,
plus UPI collect-request and statement-narration standards. A collect request
or AutoPay pre-debit notice is future intent and must never post as spending.

## Decision order

1. Resolve authentication, failed, future, informational or posted status.
2. Ground amount and currency, preserving ambiguous interpretations.
3. Separate transaction amount from balance, limit, due and fee figures.
4. Resolve debit/credit direction.
5. Identify purchase, transfer, cash, refund, fee, utility or recurring family.
6. Suggest a category only when evidence is explicit.
7. Treat explicit recurring language as a recurring-payment candidate, then
   detect subscriptions across posted history; one merchant charge is never enough.

Mandates, standing instructions and direct-debit notices are structured
schedule evidence, not proof that the economic family is a cancellable
subscription. A utility, loan, insurance payment or investment can use the
same payment scheme. Lifecycle messages (create, modify, pause, resume,
cancel) remain informational; pre-debit notices remain future; neither writes
money. Full mandate/reference values are not copied into review reports.

When two nearby figures cannot be safely clause-scoped—for example a charge
immediately followed by an available balance—the review inspector refuses to
choose a primary amount. Exact bank-template grammar may later recover those
false negatives; the generic layer must not guess.

OTP/3DS, collect requests, pre-debit notices, declines, statements, balances,
marketing and phishing-like messages are forbidden imports even when they
contain a valid amount and merchant.

"Pending" anywhere in a message (also `pendente`, `pendiente`, `ausstehend`,
`en attente`, `in attesa`, `in behandeling`, `em processamento`, `awaiting`,
`معلق`) makes it non-posting: "Transfer … received from JOHN, pending
confirmation" stays reviewable but can never post, including through a
certified template. "Your payment to Jane was received by her/their bank"
describes the recipient's receipt, so its direction is left unresolved for
Review instead of being read as money in.

## Fixture provenance

Every fixture must say whether it is:

- `standard-derived`: sanitized from a bank/network standard;
- `synthetic`: invented to exercise a grammar edge;
- `consented-redacted`: a real alert, redacted locally with explicit consent.

Synthetic and standard-derived fixtures can build and review a pack. They can
never contribute to an automatic-import score. Every benchmark fixture records
its institution, channel, template version and authoring/held-out split.
Evaluation uses only consented, redacted, held-out real alerts, and the gate
closes if one institution/channel/template version appears in both splits.

## Best-effort automatic posting (unverified formats)

The gates below decide when a pack becomes *verified*. Separately, by product
decision, an alert in an unverified format may be added before that, through
one policy only: `decideBestEffortAutoPost` in `src/lib/best-effort-autopost.ts`.
It never touches the UAE/Saudi launch grammar or a certified template. It never
runs for an AE/SA sender or an alert routed to AE/SA. When the launch grammar
declines such an alert on a non-Gulf ledger, the strict, unmarked universal seam
that shipped before this policy still applies, and the setting does not affect
it. Every guardrail is required:

- the setting "Auto-add alerts from unverified bank formats" is on (the
  default; off restores review-first for every unverified format);
- the universal parser reads `posted`, and an independent wording guard finds
  no pending/hold/authorisation, request, declined/failed, reversed/cancelled,
  OTP/verification, promotion, statement/bill/due/reminder or future/scheduled/
  mandate language (English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch,
  Portuguese, Arabic). Temporary authorisations, holds and charges are refused,
  and so is a bare "authorised/authorisation" unless the text also says
  completed, posted or settled;
- a supported family (purchase, cash withdrawal, refund, fee, utility,
  recurring payment, transfer) whose direction matches it: refunds are
  credits, transfers must state their direction and post as transfers;
- exactly one principal amount (a role-separated balance is allowed);
- an explicit ISO currency or proven symbol. A shared symbol (`$`, `¥`, `Rs`)
  resolves only to the user's own country's currency, so a `$` alert for a
  user in Germany stays in Review;
- a date that is not in the future;
- foreign money converts only with a dated rate already on the device (or the
  card's own charged figure checked against one), otherwise Review with
  `fx-rate-unavailable`;
- a pinned ledger currency, so a best-effort row can never make a batch
  mixed-currency (an AED/SAR ledger additionally requires a single non-Gulf route).

Posted rows still pass the import planner's duplicate guard and Wallet
near-match hold. Each carries `bestEffort: {v, format, market}`, with
code-owned identifiers only and never message text. A best-effort row never
stores the message excerpt that low-confidence rows otherwise keep. The row is
shown as "Auto-added — check", with "Looks right" (clears the marker), edit
(saving clears it) and "Undo — remove" (after a confirmation). A proven reading
of the same alert that later merges into the row also clears the marker.
Undo, deletion, undoing the import batch and deleting the account all remove
marked rows and record bounded tombstones in the same state write: the exact
source key, plus the observation time with ledger currency and amount
(`t{ts}:{currency}{minor}`). Rescans, parser re-reads and History imports then
skip that reading. A different amount at the same time is a different movement
and is not suppressed. The setting is mirrored in the foreground store and in the
killed-process Android capture wake. A failed save reverts the switch. Transactions
can be filtered to "Auto-added to check", and Review links to that list.

Channels: Android SMS inbox and delivery, Android bank-app notifications
(including green semantic generalisation, which uses the same policy with the
`semantic` format prefix) and the iOS Messages History import. iOS live capture
(`ios-local-capture.ts`) builds its parser sessions with the policy disabled,
so it stays review-only for unverified formats. None of this is a claim of verified coverage for any bank outside
AE/SA.

## Automatic-import gates

Per market/bank pack, automatic import requires:

- at least 300 consented, redacted held-out real fixtures across at least five institutions;
- at least 60 held-out non-posted alerts and 10 examples of every required
  purchase, transfer, cash, refund, fee, utility, recurring, statement, balance
  and authentication family;
- at least 20 failed/declined and 20 future/pre-debit held-out alerts;
- posted-vs-non-posted precision of at least 99.7%;
- posted-transaction recall of at least 95%;
- exact posting-status accuracy of at least 99%;
- exact amount, currency and direction of at least 99.5%;
- family precision of at least 98%;
- recurring-alert precision of at least 98%, preferring lower recall to false recurring labels;
- duplicate-creation rate no higher than 0.1%;
- zero forbidden imports;
- zero regressions in the complete UAE/Saudi suite.

These are engineering launch gates, not regulator-provided thresholds. Passing
them makes a pack eligible for a limited bank/template rollout; it does not
turn on an entire country. Physical shadow telemetry and user confirmation
remain required before broader enablement.

The recurring-alert metric measures single-message classification only. It is
not a subscription-accuracy claim. Subscription accuracy requires a separate
held-out sequence benchmark through the history-based detector, including
variable utilities, mandate lifecycle changes, cross-account fees and explicit
user dismissals.
